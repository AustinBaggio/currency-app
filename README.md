# currencyApp

A simple flutter currency app that uses api.exchangeratesapi.io to get and display currency information. The goal of this was to learn how to automatically generate JSON serializable objects. This was acheived using:
```
  build_runner: 
  json_serializable: 
  json_model:
    // flutter packages pub run json_model
 ```
